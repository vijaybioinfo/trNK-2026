## Raw data access
The single-cell RNA-seq raw and processed files from scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data can be downloaded through the following GEO accession number:  

## Raw data pre-processing 
For more specific information about the data generation and processing, please check the "methods" section within the manuscript.  

> Relevant scripts for both 5'v2 scRNA-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics data are all located in: ./pre-processing 

### Single-cell RNA-seq
• To do the 10x demultiplexing and mapping pull [our in-house pipeline](https://github.com/vijaybioinfo/cellranger_wrappeR) using Cell Ranger.  
• To do the donor demultiplexing pull [our in-house pipeline](https://github.com/vijaybioinfo/ab_capture).  
• To do the single-cell quality control pull [our in-house pipeline](https://github.com/vijaybioinfo/quality_control).  
• To do the doublet detection use [our in-house pipeline](https://github.com/vijaybioinfo/doublet_detection) using Scrublet.  
• To generate the clustering of single-cell data just pull [our in-house pipeline](https://github.com/vijaybioinfo/clustering) using Seurat.  
• To do the aggregation of VDJ libraries pull [our in-house pipeline](https://github.com/vijaybioinfo/VDJ_aggr).  

### Spatial Transcriptomics
• To generate the clustering of Spatial Transcriptomics data just pull [our in-house pipeline](https://github.com/vijaybioinfo/Xenium-clustering/) using Seurat.  

## Figures
